### Overview

This is the solution to the 2nd Programming Assignment for Coursera R Programming Course. 

NOTE: The optional test suite has been implemented during development, based on the RUnit package, 
though it goes beyond the scope of the assignment. 

If you want to run the test suite, make sure that RUnit package is installed, change working directory to this folder and run function runSuite().
